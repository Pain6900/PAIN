  "PREFIX": "%",
  "approveemoji": "EMOJIID",
  "denyemoji": "EMOJIID",
  "erroremoji": "EMOJIID"
}

It is important that you fill in every item of the JSON FILE! every emoji used in this BOT is a custom emoji,
the emojis are listed down below as images, which you can download and upload to your server to use them.
NOTE: you gotta change emoji.id to emoji.name if you use discord / unicode emojis! Soon a new Repo with 
standard emojis will be awailable for easy usages!
